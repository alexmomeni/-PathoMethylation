# PathoMethylation
Linking Pathology Images and DNA Methylation

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently placed new emphasis on the integration of genetic information for the diagnosis of glioma given its potential to improve disease understanding and to guide personalized therapies. DNA methylation is an important mechanism regulating gene expression and its role in carcinogenesis has been extensively studied. High-throughput DNA methylation assays have recently been developed, generating vast amounts of genome wide measurements, but these are not yet performed systematically. In contrast, pathology images are extremely common in cancer treatment as tissue sampling remains the clinical gold-standard for diagnosis. Here, we investigate the interactions between glioma histopathology images and DNA methylation. We demonstrate that classical machine learning algorithms can predict patient methylation profiles using only morphometric features extracted from pathology images. These methylation profiles span a wide range of genes and we apply consensus clustering to show that a more robust model can be built to predict the methylation state of clusters of genes. We further interpret these gene clusters using  gene set enrichment and pathway analysis. Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization power with an extension to renal clear cell carcinoma.
