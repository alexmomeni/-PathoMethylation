# PathoMethylation
Linking Pathology Images and DNA Methylation

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently placed new emphasis on the integration of genetic and molecular information for the classification of gliomas. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression and its role in carcinogenesis has been extensively studied. High-throughput DNA methylation assays have recently been developed, generating vast amounts of genome wide measurements. Pathology images are common in cancer treatment given tissue sampling remains the clinical gold-standard for diagnosis. We investigate the interactions between glioma histopathology images and DNA methylation to provide a better understanding of tumor pathobiology and progression at the epigenetic level. We demonstrate that classical machine learning algorithms can predict patient methylation profiles using only morphometric features extracted from pathology images. These methylation profiles span a wide range of genes and we apply consensus clustering to show that a more robust model can be built to predict the methylation state of clusters of genes. We further interpret these with gene enrichment analysis and image feature analysis. Finally, we evaluate our modelâ€™s generalization power with an extension to renal clear cell carcinoma.
